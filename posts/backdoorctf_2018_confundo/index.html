<p>(BackdoorCTF requests that flags aren&rsquo;t included in write-ups, so I&rsquo;ll refrain from including it and solution code here.)</p>

<p>The challenge is presented as a single file, confundo.v. The description hint simply states that the author wanted to write a challenge in an obscure language.</p>

<p>Inspecting the file, it&rsquo;s immediately obvious this is a hardware description language, and if you&rsquo;ve worked with these before you&rsquo;ll probably recognize it as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog">Verilog</a> (if you haven&rsquo;t, googling some of the syntax markers like <code>endmodule</code> will make it evident pretty quickly).</p>

<p>The file defines a module, <code>vga(clk)</code>, that takes a single clock signal as input with a few memory buffers defined, and another module used in <code>vga</code> to initialize it&rsquo;s memory buffers.</p>

<p>In particular, <code>vga</code> module has a 1024 byte <code>graphicsMem</code> buffer. On each clock cycle, <code>vga</code> reads one byte from a memory buffer, manipulates it, and writes one byte to graphicsMem. On a hunch that this was where the flag was being written, I modified the <code>vga</code> module to print <code>graphicsMems</code>&rsquo;s contents after each clock cycle.</p>

<p>Then I had to create a test bench that fed the module a clock signal. As the name implies, a test bench helps you test modules you&rsquo;ve written without hardware by simulating inputs.</p>

<p>With a simple test bench that ran for a couple thousand clock cycles, I used <a href="http://iverilog.icarus.com/">Icarus Verilog</a> to run the simulation. Once that was installed:</p>

<pre><code>$ iverilog test_bench.v
$ ./a.out &gt; test_bench_out
$ less test_bench_out
</code></pre>

<p>Checking the output from the last iteration of the test_bench run reveals the contents of graphics memory after all of the bytes have been written.</p>

<p>It took me awhile to figure out what to do with the bytes, and I thought it might have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VGA-compatible_text_mode">VGA-compatible text mode</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format#Pixel_storage">Bitmap encoding</a>. Eventually though I realized all the bytes were in the ASCII range. I dumped the output into a Hex to ASCII converter and was greeted by the flag!</p>

<p>Final note on the flag: After attempting to input various versions of the flag without success, I asked an organizer about it and the actual flag has _&rsquo;s and not -&rsquo;s.</p>
